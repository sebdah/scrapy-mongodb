scrapy-mongodb
==============
MongoDB pipeline for Scrapy. This module supports both MongoDB in standalone setups and replica sets. This module will insert the items to MongoDB as soon as your spider finds data to extract.

`scrapy-mongodb` can also buffer objects if you prefer to write chunks of data to MongoDB rather than one write per document. See the `MONGODB_BUFFER_DATA` option for details.

Installation
------------
Install via `pip`:

    pip install scrapy-mongodb

Configuration
-------------

### Basic configuration example
Add `scrapy-mongodb` to your projects `settings.py` file.

    ITEM_PIPELINES = [
      'scrapy_mongodb.MongoDBPipeline',
    ]

    MONGODB_URI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017'
    MONGODB_DATABASE = 'scrapy'
    MONGODB_COLLECTION = 'my_items'

If you want a unique key in your database, add the key to the configuration like this:

    MONGODB_UNIQUE_KEY = 'url'

### Configure MongoDB replica sets

You can configure `scrapy-mongodb` to support MongoDB replica sets simply by adding the `MONGODB_REPLICA_SET` and `MONGODB_REPLICA_SET_HOSTS` config option:

    MONGODB_REPLICA_SET = 'myReplicaSetName'
    MONGODB_URI = 'mongodb://host1.example.com:27017,host2.example.com:27017,host3.example.com:27017'

If you need to ensure that your data has been replicated, use the `MONGODB_REPLICA_SET_W` option. It is an implementation of the `w` parameter in `pymongo`. Details from the `pymongo` documentation:

    Write operations will block until they have been replicated to the specified number or tagged set of servers. w=<int> always includes the replica set primary (e.g. w=3 means write to the primary and wait until replicated to two secondaries). Passing w=0 disables write acknowledgement and all other write concern options.

### Configure data buffering

To ease the load on MongoDB `scrapy-mongodb` has a buffering feature. You can enable it by simply setting the `MONGODB_BUFFER_DATA` to the buffer size you want. If you set it to `10` `scrapy-mongodb` will write 10 documents at a time to MongoDB.

    MONGODB_BUFFER_DATA = 10

It is not possible to combine this feature with `MONGODB_UNIQUE_KEY`. Technically due to that the `update` method in `pymongo` doesn't support multi doc updates.

### Adding timestamps

`scrapy-mongodb` can append a timestamp to your item when inserting it to the database. Enable this feature by like this:

    MONGODB_ADD_TIMESTAMP = True

This will modify the document to look something like this:

    {
        ...
        'scrapy-mongodb': {
            'ts': ISODate("2013-01-10T07:43:56.797Z")
        }
        ...
    }

The timestamp is in UTC.
